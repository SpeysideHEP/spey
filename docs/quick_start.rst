Quick Start
===========

Installation
------------

``spey`` is available at `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/spey/>`_ , so it can be installed by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> pip install spey


Python >=3.8 is required. spey heavily relies on `numpy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/>`_, 
`scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/>`_ and `autograd <https://github.com/HIPS/autograd>`_ 
which are all packaged during the installation with the necessary versions. Note that some 
versions may be restricted due to numeric stability and validation.

What is Spey?
-------------

Spey is a plug-in-based statistics tool designed to consolidate a wide range of 
likelihood prescriptions in a comprehensive platform. Spey empowers users to integrate 
different statistical models seamlessly and explore 
their properties through a unified interface by offering a flexible workspace. 
To ensure compatibility with existing and future 
statistical model prescriptions, Spey adopts a versatile plug-in system. This approach enables 
developers to propose and integrate their statistical model prescriptions, thereby expanding
the capabilities and applicability of Spey.


.. _sec:first_steps:

First Steps
-----------

First, one needs to choose which backend to work with. By default, Spey is shipped with various types of 
likelihood prescriptions which can be checked via :func:`~spey.AvailableBackends` 
function

.. code-block:: python3

    >>> import spey
    >>> print(spey.AvailableBackends())
    >>> # ['default_pdf.correlated_background',
    >>> #  'default_pdf.effective_sigma',
    >>> #  'default_pdf.third_moment_expansion',
    >>> #  'default_pdf.uncorrelated_background']

For details on all the backends, see `Plug-ins section <plugins.html>`_.

Using ``'default_pdf.uncorrelated_background'`` one can simply create single or multi-bin
statistical models:

.. code:: python

    >>> pdf_wrapper = spey.get_backend('default_pdf.uncorrelated_background')

    >>> data = [1]
    >>> signal_yields = [0.5]
    >>> background_yields = [2.0]
    >>> background_unc = [1.1]

    >>> stat_model = pdf_wrapper(
    ...     signal_yields=signal_yields,
    ...     background_yields=background_yields,
    ...     data=data,
    ...     absolute_uncertainties=background_unc,
    ...     analysis="single_bin", 
    ...     xsection=0.123,
    ... )

where ``data`` indicates the observed events, ``signal_yields`` and ``background_yields`` represents
yields for signal and background samples and ``background_unc`` shows the absolute uncertainties on 
the background events, i.e. :math:`2.0\pm1.1` in this particular case. Note that we also introduced 
``analysis`` and ``xsection`` information which are optional where the ``analysis`` indicates an unique
identifier for the statistical model, and ``xsection`` is the cross-section value of the signal, which is
only used for the computation of the excluded cross-section value.

During the computation of any probability distribution, Spey relies on the so-called "expectation type". 
This can be set via :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType`, which includes three different expectation modes.

* :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.observed`: Indicates that the computation of the log-probability will be 
  achieved by fitting the statistical model on the experimental data. For the exclusion limit computation,
  this will tell the package to compute observed :math:`1-CL_s` values. :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.observed`
  has been set as default throughout the package.

* :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.aposteriori`: This command will result in the same log-probability computation
  as :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.observed`. However, the expected exclusion limit will be computed by centralising
  the statistical model on the background and checking :math:`\pm1\sigma` and :math:`\pm2\sigma` fluctuations.

* :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.apriori`: Indicates that the observation has never taken place and the theoretical
  SM computation is the absolute truth. Thus, it replaces observed values in the statistical model with the 
  background values and computes the log-probability accordingly. Similar to :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.aposteriori`
  Exclusion limit computation will return expected limits.

To compute the observed exclusion limit for the above example, one can type

.. code:: python

    >>> for expectation in spey.ExpectationType:
    >>>     print(f"1-CLs ({expectation}): {stat_model.exclusion_confidence_level(expected=expectation)}")
    >>> # 1-CLs (apriori): [0.49026742260475775, 0.3571003642744075, 0.21302512037071475, 0.1756147641077802, 0.1756147641077802]
    >>> # 1-CLs (aposteriori): [0.6959976874809755, 0.5466491036450178, 0.3556261845401908, 0.2623335168616665, 0.2623335168616665]
    >>> # 1-CLs (observed): [0.40145846656558726]

Note that :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.apriori` and :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.aposteriori` expectation types 
resulted in a list of 5 elements which indicates :math:`-2\sigma,\ -1\sigma,\ 0,\ +1\sigma,\ +2\sigma` standard deviations
from the background hypothesis. :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.observed`, on the other hand, resulted in a single value, which is 
the observed exclusion limit. Notice that the bounds on :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.aposteriori` are slightly more potent than 
:obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.apriori`; this is due to the data value has been replaced with background yields, 
which are larger than the observations. :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.apriori` is mainly used in theory 
collaborations to estimate the difference from the Standard Model rather than the experimental observations.

.. note::

    For details on exclusion limit and upper limit computations, see ref. :cite:`Cowan:2010js`.

One can play the same game using the same backend for multi-bin histograms as follows;

.. code:: python

    >>> pdf_wrapper = spey.get_backend('default_pdf.uncorrelated_background')

    >>> data = [36, 33]
    >>> signal_yields = [12.0, 15.0]
    >>> background_yields = [50.0,48.0]
    >>> background_unc = [12.0,16.0]

    >>> stat_model = pdf_wrapper(
    ...     signal_yields=signal_yields,
    ...     background_yields=background_yields,
    ...     data=data,
    ...     absolute_uncertainties=background_unc,
    ...     analysis="multi_bin", 
    ...     xsection=0.123,
    ... )

Note that our statistical model still represents individual bins of the histograms independently however, it sums up the 
log-likelihood of each bin. Hence, all bins are completely uncorrelated from each other. Computing the exclusion limits
for each :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType` will yield

.. code:: python

    >>> for expectation in spey.ExpectationType:
    >>>     print(f"1-CLs ({expectation}): {stat_model.exclusion_confidence_level(expected=expectation)}")
    >>> # 1-CLs (apriori): [0.971099302028661, 0.9151646569018123, 0.7747509673901924, 0.5058089246145081, 0.4365406649302913]
    >>> # 1-CLs (aposteriori): [0.9989818194986659, 0.9933308419577298, 0.9618669253593897, 0.8317680908087413, 0.5183060229282643]
    >>> # 1-CLs (observed): [0.9701795436411219]

It is also possible to compute :math:`1-CL_s` value with respect to the parameter of interest, :math:`\mu`.
This can be achieved by including a value for ``poi_test`` argument

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> poi = np.linspace(0,10,20)
    >>> poiUL = np.array([stat_model.exclusion_confidence_level(poi_test=p, expected=spey.ExpectationType.aposteriori) for p in poi])
    >>> plt.plot(poi, poiUL[:,2], color="tab:red")
    >>> plt.fill_between(poi, poiUL[:,1], poiUL[:,3], alpha=0.8, color="green", lw=0)
    >>> plt.fill_between(poi, poiUL[:,0], poiUL[:,4], alpha=0.5, color="yellow", lw=0)
    >>> plt.plot([0,10], [.95,.95], color="k", ls="dashed")
    >>> plt.xlabel(r"${\rm signal\ strength}\ (\mu)$")
    >>> plt.ylabel("$1-CL_s$")
    >>> plt.xlim([0,10])
    >>> plt.ylim([0.6,1.01])
    >>> plt.text(0.5,0.96, r"$95\%\ {\rm CL}$")
    >>> plt.show()

Here in the first line, we extract :math:`1-CL_s` values per POI for :obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.aposteriori` 
expectation type, and we plot specific standard deviations, which provides the following plot:

.. image:: ./figs/brazilian_plot.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 70
    :alt: Exclusion confidence level with respect to the parameter of interest, :math:`\mu`.

The excluded value of POI can also be retrieved by :func:`~spey.StatisticalModel.poi_upper_limit` function

.. code:: python

    >>> print("POI UL: %.3f" % stat_model.poi_upper_limit(expected=spey.ExpectationType.aposteriori))
    >>> # POI UL:  0.920

which is the exact point where the red curve and black dashed line meet. The upper limit for the :math:`\pm1\sigma`
or :math:`\pm2\sigma` bands can be extracted by setting ``expected_pvalue`` to ``"1sigma"`` or ``"2sigma"`` 
respectively, e.g.

.. code:: python

    >>> stat_model.poi_upper_limit(expected=spey.ExpectationType.aposteriori, expected_pvalue="1sigma")
    >>> # [0.5507713378348318, 0.9195052042538805, 1.4812721449679866]

At a lower level, one can extract the likelihood information for the statistical model by calling 
:func:`~spey.StatisticalModel.likelihood` and :func:`~spey.StatisticalModel.maximize_likelihood` functions.
By default, these will return negative log-likelihood values, but this can be changed via ``return_nll=False``
argument. 

.. code:: python
    :linenos:

    >>> muhat_obs, maxllhd_obs = stat_model.maximize_likelihood(return_nll=False, )
    >>> muhat_apri, maxllhd_apri = stat_model.maximize_likelihood(return_nll=False, expected=spey.ExpectationType.apriori)

    >>> poi = np.linspace(-3,4,60)

    >>> llhd_obs = np.array([stat_model.likelihood(p, return_nll=False) for p in poi])
    >>> llhd_apri = np.array([stat_model.likelihood(p, expected=spey.ExpectationType.apriori, return_nll=False) for p in poi])

Here in first two lines, we extracted maximum likelihood and the POI value that maximises the likelihood for two different
expectation type. In the following, we computed likelihood distribution for various POI values, which then can be plotted
as follows

.. code:: python

    >>> plt.plot(poi, llhd_obs/maxllhd_obs, label=r"${\rm observed\ or\ aposteriori}$")
    >>> plt.plot(poi, llhd_apri/maxllhd_apri, label=r"${\rm apriori}$")
    >>> plt.scatter(muhat_obs, 1)
    >>> plt.scatter(muhat_apri, 1)
    >>> plt.legend(loc="upper right")
    >>> plt.ylabel(r"$\mathcal{L}(\mu,\theta_\mu)/\mathcal{L}(\hat\mu,\hat\theta)$")
    >>> plt.xlabel(r"${\rm signal\ strength}\ (\mu)$")
    >>> plt.ylim([0,1.3])
    >>> plt.xlim([-3,4])
    >>> plt.show()

    :align: center
    :scale: 70
    :alt: Likelihood distribution for a multi-bin statistical model.

Notice the slight difference between likelihood distributions because of the use of different expectation types.
The dots on the likelihood distribution represent the point where the likelihood is maximised. Since for an 
:obj:`~spey.ExpectationType.apriori` likelihood distribution observed and background values are the same, the likelihood
should peak at :math:`\mu=0`.
